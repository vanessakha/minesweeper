# minesweeper

================= Description ======================
This is a command-line minesweeper program written in C. 
It takes advantage of structs to capture the state of the board and tiles. The user can input dimensions for the board and customize the number of mines they want through the command line, and then input whether they want to flag, unflag, or reveal the tile. Each iteration of the do-while loop captures a turn, and the game ends when the player hits a mine (loses) or flags all mines (wins).
